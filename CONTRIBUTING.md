# Contributing to Lumina Host

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Lumina Host. To maintain the integrity, security, and performance of this project, all contributors must adhere to the following guidelines.

## Code Standards

All submissions must align with the project's core technical philosophy:

*   **Security-First:** Security is non-negotiable. All inputs must be validated, and errors must be handled gracefully. Brevity is never an excuse for vulnerability.
*   **Minimalism:** Aim for production-ready solutions using the fewest lines of code possible. Avoid bloat.
*   **Self-Documenting:** Use clear, intentional naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
*   **Performance:** Code must be optimized for production environments.

### Forbidden

*   Placeholder comments (e.g., `// Add logic here`).
*   Overly verbose internal documentation.
*   Unvalidated user inputs.
*   Deprecated or insecure methods.

## Submission Process

1.  **Fork and Branch:** Fork the repository and create a feature branch from the main development branch.
2.  **Validation:** Ensure the code is functional, secure, and adheres to the standards listed above.
